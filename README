A very simple boiler-plate code for accessing the system camera in your browser / web application, using HTML5's WebRTC and Javascript.

It reads the camera input via the <code>video</code> tag and the getUserMedia() API exposed by the browser. We then capture the video feed, read it frame-by-frame and render it in a canvas element at 60 frames per second. You can uncomment the middle section to apply effects like thresholding/motion-detection etc.

This was made by following the tutorials at:
